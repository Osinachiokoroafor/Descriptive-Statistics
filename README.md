# README

This repository contains JavaScript code demonstrating the use of classes and descriptive statistics.

## Contents

MyClass.js: A class showcasing static properties and methods, as well as instance methods.
DescriptiveStatistics.js: A class for computing various descriptive statistics, including measures of central tendency and dispersion.
README.md: This file (you're reading it now!).
## Usage

To run the code:

Open a terminal in the project directory.
Run node MyClass.js to see examples of static and instance methods.
Run node DescriptiveStatistics.js to see examples of descriptive statistic calculations.
To use the classes in your own projects:

Import the necessary classes:
JavaScript
import MyClass from './MyClass.js';
import DescriptiveStatistics from './DescriptiveStatistics.js';
Use code with caution. Learn more
Create instances and use their methods as shown in the examples.
## Key Concepts

Classes: A blueprint for creating objects with properties and methods.
Static properties and methods: Shared properties and methods that belong to the class itself, not individual instances.
Instance properties and methods: Properties and methods that belong to individual instances of a class.
Descriptive statistics: Summary statistics that describe the central tendency, dispersion, and shape of a dataset.
